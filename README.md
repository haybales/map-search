Map-Search
---

#### Basic map search using react, leaflet, and Google's places API.

I used the create-react-app boilerplate to get started on this project, itself utilizing a webpack workflow for on-the-fly code refreshing in-browser and babel for ES6 transpiling. The method I used was fairly simple, as there already exists a well-documented `react-leaflet` npm package, however the choice to use leaflet rather than the native google maps API was intentional, I have used the google maps API before, so I wanted to see how I could use something new.

To Run, simply open `index.html` in the `build` directory.

The source code is in the `src` directory.
